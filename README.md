With the advancement of technology and the development of society, more and more data are flooding our daily life. But most of the data is useless, such as the detection of electromagnetic information in space, most of the data is useless. In this regard, how to extract useful information from massive data is a common goal of mankind. With the implementation of new big data analysis technologies, the valuable data in big data will be better explored and mined. The project uses big data methods to analyse atmospheric science and climate model data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). However, after testing the technology applied on the client side, it took much longer than expected to analyze the data. In this report, I will show how to reduce the analysis time of massive data to an acceptable range (target efficiency: less than two hours of analysis per day, 25 hours of data, about 250MB of data) and according to customer requirements, code Analysis improvements.
